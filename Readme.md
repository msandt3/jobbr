### Readme
A quick little toolchain that I used to search job opps and a few other things. Generally used as a refresher for data engineering patterns and exploring some tools I didnt have the chance to play with during my previous roles leading teams. 

## Running
This is aimed at running in devcontainers - so it should _just work_ if you have that running. 


### TODO
- Email out top 3 jobs for the day
- DUCK DB SOURCE- Tests & more tests
- Deployment
